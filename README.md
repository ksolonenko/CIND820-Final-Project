# CIND820 Final Project

  This repository contains related documents and source code for my final project in the CIND820: Big Data Analytics Project course at Ryerson University. 

  Please note that my .ipynb files seem to not show visualizations when uploaded to Github, but Markdown .md files work just fine. 
  Please refer to the .md file to look at coding results as the code is exactly the same for both.
  
# Abstract
  With the rise of online review platforms and social media, it is becoming increasingly important for businesses to analyze public opinion about a product or service through customer feedback to have a leading edge over their competitors. Manually sorting through thousands of reviews and social media posts is very time consuming and inefficient, thus it is more beneficial for various industries to make this analysis through machine learning. Insights from this exploration can be used to monitor the strengths and weaknesses of a product, while comparing it to how other products are received online. 

  In this project, I will be focusing on text mining and sentiment analysis, which  are commonly used methods for categorizing and analyzing bodies of text. 
The dataset that I will be using is the Large Movie Review Dataset¹, which is a publicly available dataset. This dataset has a total of 50,000 movie reviews split into a 25,000 review training set and a 25,000 review testing set, with every review labeled as having a negative or positive sentiment. 

  The research topic is to build a model that can predict sentiment classification based on the content of the reviews, and to analyze which common factors distinguish positive and negative reviews. To achieve this goal, the tools that I would like to use for this project are: the NLTK library in Python to process the text, TF-IDF scores to determine word weight across reviews, and naive Bayes classifier to predict outcomes.

# Project Structure 

1) Abstract - contains a brief overview of the research topic and approach taken.

2) Literature Review - contains a review of previous work related to the proposed project, and rounds out the context and background information to the research topic.

3) Initial Results - the initial results of the coding portion of this assignment. Coding is done in python and presented in IPYNB format for visualizations. 

4) Final Results - will contain the final code, as well as full analysis of results.
